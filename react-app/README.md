# Getting Started with Flask + React

### Create a virtual env(Inside project folder)
Clone Github repo and then you can install frontend dependencies inside react-app folder sing node package manager & backend dependencies using pip python installer
npx create-react-app react-app

## Also we worked on FLASK + EXPRESS SERVER 
Since flask and express both are using node js , so things were quite different, but then React part remains almost the same.
You can check out that project as well:  https://github.com/coderkabh/Show_My_Folio

### How it will work: 
templates folder will contain index.html once you create a build version of your react-frontend
Run main.py available in the flask-backend folder to start the flask server
Now start react application using npm start (will serve the web application)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run eject`

It will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them.
Make changes here as to where you want to build (inside static/react)

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
